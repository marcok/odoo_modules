                Employee Time Clock calculates over- and undertime, this information is displayed and stored in employees timesheets.</br>
				The user see the current account balance of the timesheet and the overall account balance from beginning as well on the main timesheet screen. In a new tab "attendance analysis" the totals are breaked down for each day in the timesheet period.<br/>
				The duty hours are calculated based on the timeschedule assigned to an employee/contract and therefore can be configured on a daily basis.<br/>
				On days where an approved leave exists, duty hours are set to zero.</br>
				After a timesheet is approved, the balance of the timesheet is persisted on timesheet level for performance and to avoid manipulation.</br>
				Info: This module does not change the behaviour of attendances nor worked hours on analytic accounts, it adds a new type "duty hours" and makes calculations based on that.

                For convenience, this screen gives a manger the possibility to generate multiple timesheets for all employees with a certain tag. If you wanna track over- and undertime it is recommended to generate timesheets for the whole year in advanced, usually on a monthly basis.

				Under Settings -> Human Resources you should activate "Track attendances for all employees".<br />
				If users dont have a timezone defined, you get errors on sign in/out.<br />
				Security: The module adds a rule, which allows employees to read there own contracts, this shouldn't be a problem, but you need to keep that in mind.<br />
				Security: The module adds a rule, which only allows managers to see the timesheets of there subordinates. If you want to have the old behaviour, that a manger can see all timesheets, you may set this rule inactive.

				This module is well integrated with our iPhone and iPad apps, certainly it works without the mobile apps as well. It's free up to 3 users and available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/odoo-time-clock/id995197393" target="_blank">iTunes</a>.<br/>
                Odoo time clock gives the employees the possibility to sign-in/sign-out with a 2D barcode card, e.g. on the entrance of your company where the iPad is mounted, in under 2 seconds.</br>
				The app works best with an iPad, but e.g. at an office reception it works also great with an iPhone or even an iPod touch.
